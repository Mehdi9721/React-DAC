react learning from DAC <br>
Started learning react<br>

#### React is a library not a framework;

## Components
### class Component AND Function Component
The class component(statefull) extends React.Component class and renders the html body by render() method (we return html in render method).<br>
The function component is just a normal function Which is Stateless component and directly returns the html body. <br>
#### Statefull vs stateLess
Statefull renders and manages the changes. <br>
Stateless renders props without maintaining state. <br>
